# Thesis
Detection of Windows in Outdoor RGB Images using Camera Behavior Model.

# 

# Research Objectives
1. Semantic analysis of the windows. 
2. Use a Pre-trained model.
3. Apply State-of-the-Art Deep learning-based models.
4. Examining the mean intersection over union.
5. Sematic analysis 
-with two inputs (Numerical + Image) and segmentation as output

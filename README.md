# Thesis
Detection of Windows in Outdoor RGB Images using Camera Behavior Model.


# Research Objectives:
1. Semantic analysis of the windows (Glass).

2. Use a Pre-trained model.

3. Apply State-of-the-Art Deep learning-based models.

4. Examining the mean intersection over union.

5. Semantic analysis - -with two inputs (Numerical + Image) and segmentation as output

   
# Considerations for Object Segmentation:
1. Multi-perspective exposures and data from events [2].

2.  Fusion approach from FGT-NET [5].


3. Fusion while performing Semantic Segmentation (which is Pixel-wise classification).


4. Transfer learning and fine-tuning  for better optimization of results.

 
5. Encoder – Pre-trained model DenseNet201 [6].


6. Decoder – U_net [7].
